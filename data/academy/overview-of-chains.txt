The Chains tab is where you can explore and analyze location-based data about chains or custom groupings of POIs thar you have created as Tags in My Zone.  The video above provides a brief introduction to the features and functionality of the Chains section.

Chains Reports Highlights
Chains reports allow you to analyze between one and eight chains and compare these to each other.  A secondary navigation menu along the left organizes the robust data available for exploration and analysis.

Below is an introduction to the most popular reports within the Chains section:

Overview: Overview summarizes Placerâ€™s most commonly referenced data and insights for a specific chain. This includes visit metrics, visit trends, YoY metrics, Baseline Trend metrics, share-of-visits, and Ranked Venues for the selected chains.
Contacts: Our optional Contacts Product allows you to easily connect with company representatives, franchisees, and franchisors for your selected chains.
Demographics: Demographics provides a variety of demographic and psychographic insights about chain visitors and the population living within its trade areas

Variance: Variance is used heavily to measure differences in visitation or foot traffic. Variance reports allow you to easily compare the foot traffic of a chain to previous weeks, previous months, or even previous years.

Frequent Co-Tenants: This tool allows you to search for specific chains to view a list of other chains they are frequently located near or with (in the same shopping center).
