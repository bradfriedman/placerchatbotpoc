Subtitle: How to find & request new public POIs via the Placer dashboard

It's easy to search for existing POIs via Placer's Explore map, and to request new POIs via our Help & Support center. Watch the short video above to learn all of the details, or skim the highlights below for an overview.

Step 1:Search for a specific POI
a. After logging in, you will be brought to the Explorer view, which is an interactive map of the United States.
b. To navigate to a specific POI you have three options:

i. Drag the map and zoom into the location.

ii. Use the upper search bar if you know the specific POI name (red box).

iii. Use the lower search bar if you have the POI address (green box).
c. Once you find the POI you’re looking for, you’ll be able to open a Property report by clicking on Open Report and then Property.

Step 2:Request that a specific POI be added to the platform
a. To request a POI, click on Help & Feedback tab in the middle right side of the screen.
b. If you only have a single location to request, choose "Request a Single POI".
c. Complete the request form.
d. Click submit, and your request will be sent to Placer Support. Please note that it can take between 3-5 days for a POI to be verified. If you want more information,  please view the video above or contact your CSM for help.

e. If you have a list of POIs to request, choose the second box labeled "Request Multiple POIs". Download the blank template using the hyperlink. Fill in details for all requested locations (name, full street address) and save as a CSV. Come back into the "Request Multiple POIs" button, and submit the spreadsheet by Adding File.
